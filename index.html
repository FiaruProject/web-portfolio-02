            <p>Social media and related technologies have become pervasive in modern society. The pace at which technology changes, along with its rapid acceptance, adoption, and insertion into the social environment, occurs without much thought to potential, negative side effects. One possible casualty of this relationship is social skills. It has become commonplace to regularly check and/or send a text message, take a phone call, or update a Facebook status in the middle of a live social situation. The impact of these interactions may lead to a decline in the ability to develop, grow, and succeed in important social arenas, including work life, intimate relationships, and friendships. While there are certainly benefits to social media, it seems that most of what we know about its impacts is largely anecdotal and the need to understand the potential negative fallout from the use of technology mediated social interaction could be important in clinical settings with respect to the development of a holistic treatment plan for individuals of all age ranges, races, and genders. This paper summarizes research, based on my dissertation, which found interesting correlations between social media, anxiety, well-being, and social skills and socially mediated technologies.</p>
